No Workshop a Ritual
A Gathering

hi everyone* and a very big welcome to DISKURS 2018 NO SERVICE…

I am looking forward to a week full of space
space for anything that we can 
and cannot imagine
but that sets into spirit
what we are longing for, 
what we are dreaming of
and what we need

i am interested in what this is for you, 
and I am interested in the reality of my fantasies.

we are trying to b softer with each other
and we are trying to embrace failure 

as we understood that inventing takes time, space and patience
to get rid of a vocabulary that doesn’t serve us anymore
to get rid of making sense and making more

so what you see is that we got to
in a solidarity of services
that we are no inviting you into

thank you for being here.
